Warning! Do not replace your blueprint folder with this one.
Simply copy the contents into your blueprint folder.
Location is - C:\Users\("EnterProfileHere"\AppData\Local\FactoryGame\Saved\SaveGames\blueprints typically. It might shift depending on what you have done.

These blueprints work best when they are facing you. That means that white arrow looks at you. 
You have to stand properly to allow the blueprint to snap into location after shifting it after "H" locking it in place. It takes a couple times to get used to it.

Same deal with the polygons that have been sectioned. You have to stand on the area that goes to the center to properly place the next piece after you "H" lock it into position.
